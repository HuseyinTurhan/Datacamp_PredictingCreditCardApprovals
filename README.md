# In this notebook, we built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques.


- starting off by loading and viewing the dataset,
- showing that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges,
- preprocessing the dataset to ensure the machine learning model can make good predictions,
- doing some exploratory data analysis to build intuitions,
- building a machine learning model that can predict an application for a credit card will be accepted.
